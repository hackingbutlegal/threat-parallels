# Threat Actor Parallels Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes the striking parallels between cyber attack infrastructure and disinformation operations. It maps out how techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used in malware distribution mirror those used in spreading misleading information.

## Purpose
The visualization serves to:
- Illuminate how threat actors adapt similar strategies across different domains
- Help security professionals understand emerging threats through pattern recognition
- Bridge the gap between technical and social engineering attack vectors
- Provide a framework for analyzing hybrid threats

## Key Concepts Mapped

### 1. Distribution Infrastructure
Shows how both malware and disinformation leverage:
- Automated distribution networks (botnets/sockpuppets)
- Dynamic infrastructure generation
- Platform exploitation
- Influencer dynamics
- Multi-level spreading mechanisms

### 2. Evasion Techniques
Demonstrates parallel approaches to avoiding detection:
- Polymorphic content (code mutation/content variation)
- Legitimate fa√ßades
- Timing-based deployments
- Compartmentalized operations

### 3. Targeting Methods
Maps similarities in:
- Social engineering approaches
- Trust exploitation
- A/B testing of payloads
- Demographic profiling

### 4. Persistence Mechanisms
Illustrates how both maintain long-term presence through:
- Backup communication channels
- Deep network embedding
- Resilient infrastructure
- Sustained presence

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React and Vite
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Interactive tooltips for detailed information
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Lucide icons for visual representation
