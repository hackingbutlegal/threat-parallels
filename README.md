# Threat Actor Parallels Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes the striking parallels between cyber attack infrastructure and disinformation operations. It maps out how techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) used in malware distribution mirror those used in spreading misleading information.

## Purpose
The visualization serves to:
- Illuminate how threat actors adapt similar strategies across different domains
- Help security professionals understand emerging threats through pattern recognition
- Bridge the gap between technical and social engineering attack vectors
- Provide a framework for analyzing hybrid threats

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React and Next.js
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Interactive tooltips for detailed information
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Lucide icons for visual representation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-parallels.git

# Install dependencies
cd threat-parallels
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Usage
- Hover over any item to see detailed definitions
- Compare cyber and disinformation tactics side by side
- Use for training, analysis, or threat modeling

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Areas for expansion include:
- Additional parallel patterns
- New categories of comparison
- Enhanced visualizations
- Case studies demonstrating parallels

## Educational Use
This tool can be valuable for:
- Security awareness training
- Threat analysis workshops
- Pattern recognition exercises
- Cross-domain security education

## Future Development
Possible enhancements or additions:
- Integration with DISARM framework
- Interactive case studies
- Temporal analysis of evolving patterns
- Counter-measure mapping
